# Repository for Declan Fodor's personal website.

I will not accept direct contributions of code unless there is a security flaw.


7/11/24: I am making this repository public primarily to show evidence of prior programming knowledge. That being said, this was made over half a year ago, and there are several shortcomings I would like to highlight. I dislike many of the choices I made structurally for this, and I personally believe I should have opted for something more full-featured instead of trying to combine webpack, babble, tailwind, and preact. I specifically recall that I was often fighting with tailwind and preact to do what I wanted. I do not believe this is necessarily the fault of the frameworks, but rather the fault of me trying to combine such frameworks and use them in a way that was not intended. If I did this again, I would also use something like MUI components to save time, since then I would not be writing the front-end components from scratch. I would also likely study more design patterns relating to the various web technologies. Still, I learned quite a bit while doing this, and while I did take the website down later due to disliking the high-contrast UI choice, I still think that it went decently well for the first website I put on the web, and I feel it should suffice to show that I understand some of the more basic computer science concepts.
